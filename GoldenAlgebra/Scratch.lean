/-! ## Bridge 3 — Jensen zero-count bound (the RvM / A1 / P1 main-term engine)

For an entire `f`, nonzero at the center, bounded by `M` on the sphere of radius `R`,
the weighted count of zeros in the disk of radius `r < R` is `≤ log(M/‖f c‖)/log(R/r)`.
This is the Mathlib-grounded RvM upper bound: it directly majorizes `canonicalShellCard`
and the `N(T)` main term feeding the Turing envelope. -/

lets `logDeriv_tprod_eq_tsum` discharge the genus-1 Hadamard `logDeriv = Σ` field. -/

/-! ## Bridge 5 — Jensen + order-≤1 growth ⟹ explicit linear zero count

Compose Bridge 3 with an order-≤1 growth bound `‖f z‖ ≤ exp(A·‖z−c‖)` on the
sphere of radius `R = e·r`. Choosing `R/r = e` makes `log(R/r) = 1`, collapsing
Jensen's bound to a clean **linear-in-`r`** count `≤ A·e·r − log‖f c‖`.

This is the concrete RvM-shaped consequence: it makes the only genuinely missing
input explicit — the order-1 growth constant `A` for `f = ξ` (the Γ·ζ estimate that
Mathlib does not provide). Everything else is now a compiled theorem. -/

/-! ## Bridge 6 — Jensen + ξ-type growth `exp(A·R·log R)` ⟹ `r·log r` count

Riemann ξ has order 1 of **maximal type**: its true growth is `exp(A·|s|·log|s|)`,
not `exp(A·|s|)`. With that growth on the sphere `R = e·r`, Jensen gives a count
`≤ A·(e·r)·log(e·r) − log‖f c‖`, i.e. the genuine **`N(T) ~ T·log T`** Riemann–von
Mangoldt shape. This is the correct count for ξ; Bridge 5's linear bound was for
finite-type functions only. The remaining input is exactly the constant `A` in
ξ's growth — the Γ·ζ estimate Mathlib lacks. -/

/-! ## Bridge 18 — the ACTUAL ξ, grounded in `completedRiemannZeta₀`

This is the payoff of the Mathlib v4.31 landing. The hardest classical leg of the
Hadamard program — analytic continuation of ζ, the Γ poles, the ζ pole at `s=1`,
trivial-zero cancellation, removable singularities — is ALREADY DONE in Mathlib via
`completedRiemannZeta₀` (the entire `Λ₀`). We package the completed ξ as an entire
function with one definition and reduce the proposed boss axiom `xi_entire` to a
one-line theorem.

Key algebraic identity (away from `s = 0, 1`):

/-! ## Bridge 20 — the complex-Stirling brick: `‖Γ(s)‖ ≤ Γ(Re s)` on the right half-plane

The boss (#1, the ξ growth bound) bottlenecks on a vertical-line estimate for the Gamma
factor, which the deep Mathlib survey confirmed is ABSENT. We supply its fundamental form
directly from Euler's integral `Γ(s) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-x} x^{s-1} dx` (`Complex.Gamma_eq_integral`,
valid for `Re s > 0`): since `‖x^{s-1}‖ = x^{Re s - 1}` for `x > 0`
(`norm_cpow_eq_rpow_re_of_pos`) and `e^{-x} > 0`, the triangle inequality collapses the
complex integral exactly onto the REAL Gamma integral. This `‖Γ(σ+it)‖ ≤ Γ(σ)` is the
keystone that — combined with Mathlib's real Stirling on `Γ(σ)`, the elementary
`‖π^{-s/2}‖ = π^{-σ/2}`, the absolute-convergence bound on `ζ` for `Re s > 1`, and
`PhragmenLindelof.vertical_strip` — assembles the order-1 envelope `‖ξ(s)‖ ≤ exp(A‖s‖log‖s‖)`

Mirrors `Mathlib/NumberTheory/LSeries/ZetaZeros.lean`, but ξ is ENTIRE so the argument is
strictly cleaner (no `{1}ᶜ` puncture): ξ is analytic on the connected `univ` and `ξ(0)=½≠0`,
so by `AnalyticOnNhd.preimage_zero_mem_codiscrete` the zero set is codiscrete. This furnishes
the Hadamard index type, closedness, discreteness, local finiteness of the zero divisor, the
`zeroLoc ρ ≠ 0` field, and the crucial **`cofinite → cocompact`** escape — the cofinite
Weierstrass M-test driver that makes the genus-1 product converge locally uniformly. -/

is a concrete, fully-factored majorant for `‖ξ(s)‖` on `Re s > 1`. The remaining mile to the
clean `exp(A‖s‖log‖s‖)` envelope is: bound `Γ((s/2).re)` by Stirling (`Real.Gamma σ ≤ exp(Cσlogσ)`),
absorb the `∑ₙ 1/n^σ ≤ ζ(2)` and `s(s−1)` polynomial factors into the exponential, then reflect
the left half via `entireRiemannXi_one_sub`. This brick turns the growth wall from "vague Γ·ζ

For `Re s ≤ -3`, reflect through `ξ(s) = ξ(1−s)` (`entireRiemannXi_one_sub`): then
`(1−s).re = 1 − Re s ≥ 4`, so B30 applies to `1 − s`. Together with B30 this covers the entire
plane OUTSIDE the vertical strip `-3 ≤ Re s ≤ 4`. The strip is the sole remaining region; on a
large circle it is the high-`|Im|` part, requiring either `PhragmenLindelof.vertical_strip`
(boundary bounds from B30/B31 + a crude order ceiling) or a vertical-line Γ estimate. -/

into a single pointwise order-1 envelope valid for all `‖z‖ ≥ 4`. The strip hypothesis is the
ONLY remaining analytic input — exactly the high-`|Im|` vertical-strip bound that
`PhragmenLindelof.vertical_strip` (boundary data from B30/B31) is designed to supply. Everything

Feeds the global growth envelope (B32) into the specialized Jensen bound (B19). For every

genuine `T log T` Riemann–von Mangoldt shape. This is the count half of the Hadamard program,
now reduced (like everything upstream) to the single vertical-strip growth input. -/

Instantiate the abstract product theorems on `xiZeroLoc : XiZeroIndex → ℂ`: B21 supplies the

Given inverse-square summability (item 4, gated on the divisor↔count bridge), the genus-1 product
over ξ's zeros converges locally uniformly and its log-derivative is the regularized zero sum —
exactly the Hadamard log-derivative spine `EntireXiClassicalHadamardTheorem` consumes. -/

/-!
The order of the locally-uniform genus-1 product at `z` equals the number of indices hitting `z`.

We isolate the genuinely-missing analytic-number-theory input as the hypothesis `hsplit`: near
`z`, the full product factors as the FINITE product over the indices that hit `z` times an
analytic, nonvanishing TAIL. This is exactly the content of "order of a locally-uniform product"
that Mathlib does not yet provide as a lemma (Mathlib has no `analyticOrderAt` lemma for a
`tprod` / `MultipliableLocallyUniformlyOn` product). The standard proof of `hsplit` splits the
product into the finite hitting factors times the complement tail
(`Multipliable.prod_mul_tprod_subtype_compl`, available pointwise from `hmul.multipliable`) and
shows the tail is analytic (locally-uniform limit of analytic partial products) and nonvanishing
at `z` (each tail factor is nonzero there and the product is a genuine ξ-type Hadamard product).
Everything ELSE — that this factorization forces the order to be the hitting count — is proved
here unconditionally.

/-! ## Bridge 50 — G3 CLOSED: `Σ_ρ 1/‖ρ‖² < ∞`, and UNCONDITIONAL genus-1 product convergence
Wires the unconditional RvM count (B47) through B44 + B21 into the abstract engine (B48'). Then
the genus-1 Hadamard product over ξ's zeros converges locally uniformly — UNCONDITIONALLY. -/
